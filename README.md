# Wellness_Technology_Analysis

## Project Overview

Bellabeat, a wellness technology company, seeks to understand how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to improve their marketing strategy. This project analyzes FitBit user data to discover trends in smart device usage.

## Data Sources

This analysis has used the following Fitbit datasets from Kaggle:
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv` — daily activity summaries (steps, calories, distance, etc.)
- `minuteSleep_merged.csv` — sleep data (sleep duration)

## Data Cleaning

- Removed rows with missing (`NA`) values.
- Combined sleep and activity data into a unified cleaned dataset.

## Data Analysis & Visualization

- Created three different plots exploring relationships between sleep minutes, calories burned, and steps taken.
- The plots use scatterplots and other appropriate visualizations to reveal data trends.

## Tools & Technologies

- R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- ggplot2 for plotting.
- Git and GitHub for version control.
